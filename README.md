# go-blockchain

This "blockchain" is the result of a one-hour hacknight in London's Golang meetup so don't expect much.  
Our goal was to have a very simple API for block exchange through GRPC and a basic but valid form of mining throught POW.  

Mining currently works on a single peer, a peer can connect to just one more peer, but they don't yet announce their blocks.  
Maybe we'll get one more hour at some point and wrap it up.
